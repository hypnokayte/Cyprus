		<p>Premier Stephen McNeil attributes his core values and strong commitment to public service to his large, close-knit family.</p>

		<p>Stephen, 49, is the 12th of 17 siblings who were born and raised in Nova Scotiaâ€™s beautiful Annapolis Valley.</p>

		<p>Before becoming involved in politics, Stephen graduated from Nova Scotia Community College and put down roots in Bridgetown, where he owned and operated a small business for 18 years.</p>

		<p>He was inspired to serve his community by his late mother, Theresa, who was the first female sheriff in Canada.</p>

		<p>Stephen was elected to the Legislative Assembly to serve the people of Annapolis in 2003. After winning re-election in 2006, he became leader of the Nova Scotia Liberal party in 2007.</p>

		<p>Stephen served as leader the official opposition for four years before being elected Premier on Oct. 8, 2013.</p>
		
		<p>In his election-night speech, Stephen said he was inspired by the families he met while campaigning across the province.</p>

		<blockquote>"You have told me about your hopes and dreams for a Nova Scotia where your children and grandchildren can prosper. I share that dream," he said.</blockquote>

		<p>Stephen lives in the Annapolis Valley with his wife Andrea. They have two grown children, Colleen and Jeffrey.</p>
